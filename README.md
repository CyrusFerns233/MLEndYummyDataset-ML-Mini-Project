# MLEnd Yummy Dataset Contribution

I participated in the MLEnd Yummy Dataset project, enriching the dataset with images of 16 distinct dishes I enjoyed. The process involved capturing top-view photos, utilizing Yummy cards, and saving each image with a specific filename, adhering to the standardized format. After savoring the meals, I enriched the photos by populating a spreadsheet with essential details such as dish name, ingredients, and rating. The submission required zipping the images and the spreadsheet, ensuring compliance with the specified guidelines. This collaborative initiative aims to create a diverse and publicly accessible dataset for global learning and research. It was an enjoyable experience exploring different cuisines and contributing to a valuable resource for the community. Let's continue building this amazing dataset! üç≤üì∏

### The MLEnd Yummy Dataset project encompasses two main components, each addressed in separate Jupyter notebooks: 

# MLEnd Yummy Dataset - Rice vs Chips Classifier (Basic Solution)
The basic solution focusing on a Rice vs Chips Classifier and the advanced solution involving a Diet Category Classifier. In the basic solution, the machine learning pipeline begins with data import, preprocessing, and feature extraction, culminating in the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier. The notebook meticulously details the training, evaluation, and performance metrics, offering insights into the model's ability to distinguish between rice and chips dishes. 


# MLEnd Yummy Dataset - Diet Category Classifier (Advanced Solution)
The advanced solution takes a more sophisticated approach with a convolutional neural network (CNN), leveraging techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation. The associated Jupyter notebook guides users through loading and preprocessing data, defining and compiling the CNN model, tuning hyperparameters, and training the model with augmented data. Both notebooks serve as comprehensive references, providing a transparent and reproducible overview of the entire project's methodology, from inception to model evaluation.

# Conclusion: Skills and ML Techniques Learned

Participating in the MLEnd Yummy Dataset project has been an enriching journey that significantly contributed to my skill set and understanding of various machine learning techniques. Through the process of capturing, processing, and enriching images of different dishes, I honed several valuable skills and applied sophisticated ML techniques. 

## Image Processing and Dataset Enrichment Skills

Working with real-world images demanded a solid grasp of image processing techniques. I learned to capture top-view photos, ensuring consistency by employing Yummy cards, and standardized naming conventions for filenames. The process of enriching images involved meticulous recording of essential attributes, including dish name, ingredients, and ratings, further refining my data annotation and documentation skills.

## Basic Solution: Rice vs Chips Classifier

In developing the basic solution for distinguishing between rice and chips dishes, I delved into the fundamentals of data preprocessing. Techniques such as train-test splitting, image resizing, and flattening were essential for preparing data suitable for traditional machine learning models. Feature extraction using GLCM features provided valuable insights into capturing texture information, and the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier enhanced my understanding of ensemble learning models.

## Advanced Solution: Diet Category Classifier

The advanced solution, focusing on classifying diet categories (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan), pushed the boundaries of my machine learning expertise. Loading and preprocessing images for a convolutional neural network (CNN), hyperparameter tuning, and leveraging data augmentation techniques highlighted the importance of adapting to different model architectures and optimizing for performance. The inclusion of a learning rate reduction callback demonstrated the significance of dynamic adjustments during training.

## Transferable Skills

Beyond the technical aspects, this project also nurtured transferable skills such as effective collaboration, adherence to submission guidelines, and the ability to contribute meaningfully to a shared dataset. Understanding the importance of data privacy and submission integrity were crucial takeaways, emphasizing the ethical considerations in handling real-world datasets.

In conclusion, the MLEnd Yummy Dataset project has been a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience, blending image processing, traditional machine learning, and deep learning techniques. This project has equipped me with a diverse skill set and a deeper understanding of practical challenges in working with real-world datasets, setting a solid foundation for future endeavors in machine learning and data science. The continuous growth of this dataset is a testament to the collaborative spirit of the community and the collective effort to create a valuable resource for global learning and research. üöÄüçΩÔ∏è
